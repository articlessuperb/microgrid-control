# Microgrid Resilient Control System

An intelligent, user-friendly software platform that acts as the "brain" of a localized microgrid. This software ensures **resilience during outages** through an automated, seamless transition to off-grid power and maximizes **efficiency** by intelligently managing energy sources.

-----

### Features

  * **Automated Outage Management:** Detects grid failures and seamlessly transitions to island mode.
  * **Intelligent Optimization:** Manages power based on simulated costs and demand.
  * **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides a live view of the microgrid's status.

### Getting Started

This is a conceptual blueprint. To run the simulated version, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/microgrid-control.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd microgrid-control
    ```
3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Project Status

This project is currently a **conceptual blueprint**. The core logic for a seamless grid transition is fully defined and simulated. However, the following modules are currently placeholders for future development:

  * **`api/`:** The RESTful API for remote monitoring and control.
  * **`data/`:** The database integration for storing and analyzing real-time data.
  * **`hardware/drivers/`:** The real-world drivers that would replace the simulated `HardwareInterface`.
  * **`tests/`:** The suite of unit and integration tests for a production-ready application.

These modules represent the next steps in development to turn this conceptual model into a fully robust and functional application.
